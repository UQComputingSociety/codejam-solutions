# Sharing Is Caring

## Problem Statement

You have just bought a lovely pizza as a gift for the Bananas in Pyjamas. Following the cancellation of the show, tensions have become quite high between B1 and B2. They will be very upset if the pizza cannot be divided evenly between the two of them. 

This normally wouldn't be a problem, but the pizza shop has done a horrible job of cutting the pizza into even slices. 

To avoid any conflict, the best course of action is to remove some slices of pizza, so that the remainder can be shared evenly between two, before giving it to the Bananas.

Given the sizes of $n$ slices of pizza, determine the minimum area of pizza that should be removed so that the remaining pieces can be shared evenly between two.

If the pizza cannot be shared evenly, return the total area of the pizza.

## Input Format

- The first line contains one integer $n$: the number of slices
- The second line contains $n$ integers $x_i$: the size of each slice of pizza


## Constraints

- $1 \leq n \leq 100$
- $1 \leq x_i \leq 100$

## Output Format
Output one integer: the minimum area of pizza that should be removed

## Sample Input
