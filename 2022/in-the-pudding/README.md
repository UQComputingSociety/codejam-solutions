## Author's Note

The two test cases were weighted such that the "impossible" test case was worth 99 out of 100 pts, which meant successfully working out the joke was only worth 1 pt, instead of being a potentially game-winning challenge. In the end, this challenge had three successful solves: tomle, dpaismail, and jsjamesemail.

Full credit to tmalc for the idea behind the joke.
